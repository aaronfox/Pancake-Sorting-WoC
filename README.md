Paper proving that the following parts of Tetris are NP-Complete: https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0210020v1.pdf

Quote from paper: In this paper, we prove that it is NP-complete to optimize any of several natural objective
functions for Tetris:
- maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence;
- maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs;
- maximizing the number of tetrisesâ€”the simultaneous clearing of four rows;
- minimizing the height of the highest filled gridsquare over the course of the sequence.
